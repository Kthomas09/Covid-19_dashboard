                        <p>These dashboards are designed for everyone to understand the progression of Covid-19. With
                            the help of Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, and data scraped from Data.World, we
                            will finally understand the path this disease has taken throughout the United States of
                            America. This virus was devastating early, and as the holiday season is upon us we are
                            seeing the same horror as at the beginning of 2020. However, because of the dedicated
                            medical professionals, risking their health and the health of their families, we are
                            beginning to see signs of hope. As of Dec. 14th, Pfizer has officially begun to distribute
                            their vaccines to those fighting on the front lines. These medical professionals are also
                            becoming more proficient in treating this virus. We have seen a steady decrease in the
                            mortality rate for this disease, and with a vaccine sooon on the way, we can only hope that
                            we will begin to adjust to this new normal. We will never be able to bring back our
                            loved ones, but with their dedication, perhaps we can save many more for our future. This
                            data project is dedicated to our front-line workers who are always there for us! We Thank
                            You!</p>
